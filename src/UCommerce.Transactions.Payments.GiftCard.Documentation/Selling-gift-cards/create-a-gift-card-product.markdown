# Create a Gift Card Product

Before your users can buy and use gift cards in your shop, it is essential that you have a gift card to present and add to your basket. This is handled like any other product in your shop. You need to create and categorize your gift cards so it makes sense for your shop.
When installing the gift card app it will automatically add a new product definition called 'GiftCard'. This is the definition, you have to use when creating the gift card product you want to sell in your shop.

When your gift card is created, you will see a special tab only present when the product definition is 'GiftCard'. This enables you to specify prices for your gift cards that the user will be able to select when buying a gift card.

When you manage prices, clicking on the green button enables you to add a new price tier per price group available. In the below image, I have a price group in 'Euros' and in 'Danish Kroner'. This means that you can individually manage prices per currency in your store. Prices will automatically shows on the frontend in the right currency like any other product. 

When you save the gift card product, the app will automatically create 1 variant per price entered in the backend. In the image below you'll get 5 variants with 2 prices, one in euros and one danish kroner.

When this is done, you're ready to start selling gift cards.
